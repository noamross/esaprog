# Messing around with the ESA Program

This repository contains some scripts of analyses of the program uf the
2014 [Ecological Society of America annual meeting](http://esa.org/am/program/),
as well as programs from meetings in previous years

The scripts assume you have the content of the program in the directory. I haven't
included it here for both copyright purposes and to limit the size of the repo. After cloning the repo, navigate into it and run these commands at the command line to get
the program files from the ESA website:

```
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2010/webprogram/
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2011/webprogram/
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2012/webprogram/
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2013/webprogram/
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/
wget -r http://eco.confex.com/eco/2015/webprogram/
```

These will download the relevant directories of the ESA program.
